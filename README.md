# SCARA Robot Simulation in ROS 2 Humble with MoveIt

This project simulates a four-axis SCARA robot using ROS 2 Humble and MoveIt. The model is fully defined through a modular `.xacro` file and includes three revolute joints and one prismatic joint. The simulation is visualized using RViz and uses Docker with WSL 2 for environment standardization and cross-platform compatibility.

## Project Goals

- Develop a simulated SCARA robot based on real geometry and kinematic data.
- Integrate with MoveIt for motion planning.
- Use RViz for 3D visualization of the robot and its motions.
- Apply the setup in the context of robotic dynamic design tasks.
